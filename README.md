# TrainSim
 A train simulater made to allow controlling the train with an arduino.

To setup the Arduino yourself, you will need similar components or you will need to implement the Arduino script yourself.

The Arduino project files are located under ./ArduinoProject and the API in unity is under ./Assets/Scripts/TrainBehaviour

Documentation for how to implement your own methods for either the unity project or Arduino as well as a list of components I used can be found here.
